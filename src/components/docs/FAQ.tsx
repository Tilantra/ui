A built-in Compliance Engine scans prompts and responses for PII, jailbreaks, and regulatory red flags before anything leaves the gateway. The Prompt-Suggestion endpoint instantly rewrites raw queries into expertly engineered prompts to maximize model accuracy. Every generated answer passes an automatic Plagiarism Check to flag or filter content that isn’t original. Finally, you can lock in User-defined Model Preferences, prioritizing specific vendors, regions, or on-prem deployments so your stack always aligns with policy, budget, and latency needs.'

There are also models that charge per request, for images and for reasoning tokens, and those charges are shown on the Models page as well.\n\nWhen you send a call through Guidera, the provider returns the exact token (or request) count. We translate that into the appropriate cost, subtract it from your prepaid credits, and log the result. You can see a full, line-by-line record of this activity anytime in the Dashboard.'
